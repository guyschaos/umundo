# uMundo installers

Installer packages are available at <a href="http://umundo.tk.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/installer/">the umundo
server at the TUD</a>.

The installers contain prebuilt uMundo libraries in both debug and release configuration. Debug libraries are suffixed with <tt>*_d</tt>
and contain unstripped symbols and debugging information. All installers contain libraries for Android development and the MacOSX
installer contains support for iOS devices as well.

All the different file formats per platform contain the same file, it's just a matter of taste whether you prefer archives or installation
packages.
