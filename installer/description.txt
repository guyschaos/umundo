uMundo is a publish/subscribe implementation from the Telecooperation Group at
the Technical University of Darmstadt.

uMundo is continuously updated; everything we would write here would be
out-dated in a matter of weeks. As the only thing worse than no documentation
is wrong documentation, please have a look at the website at:
https://github.com/tklab-tud/umundo for current information.
